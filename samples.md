title: Samples

We have prepared some examples, so you can see how the different parameters available in the API affect the survey.

It is worth to note that we din't use the <code>iframe</code> tag. One of the benefits is that you usually don't have to style the survey to have a look and feel similar to your site (e.g. the same font is used everywhere). Another benefit is that the survey is just as responsive as your site (see our home).
