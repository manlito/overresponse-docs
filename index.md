# Survey Configuration

By default, OverResponse requires a global variable called `ORSettings` with following attributes:

Attribute | Possible Values
--------- | ---------------
surveyId (required) | Unique survey ID 

# Events

OverResponse provides facility to handle almost all events related to the survey displaying and user interaction with the user. For instance, you can handle events to:

- Adjust your website content based on a response (e.g. Redirect respondant that says 'yes' to participate in a experiment)
- Use your own data store for responses
- Integrate with your favorite JS Framework
- Handle special events (such as bounces)
